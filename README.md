# Getting Started with Create React App

This a simple Music library app build with React Typescript. You can search for tracks by label, artist and album. It consumes an [API](https://github.com/dessHub/deezer-proxy-api), which acts as proxy to [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/api/artist).

Here is a [live demo](https://music-library-e62e4.web.app/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
